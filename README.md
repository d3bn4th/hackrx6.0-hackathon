## HackRx 6.0 Hackathon: Detailed Problem Statement

### Overview

HackRx 6.0 challenges participants to design and build an **AI-powered system** that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to process natural language queries and retrieve relevant information from large, unstructured documents. The focus is on creating solutions with real-world impact, especially in domains where document complexity and information retrieval are critical.

### Core Challenge

Participants must develop a system that can:

- **Accept natural language queries** (e.g., "46-year-old male, knee surgery in Pune, 3-month-old insurance policy").
- **Process and understand** these queries using advanced LLM capabilities.
- **Retrieve and present relevant information** from large, unstructured documents such as:
  - Policy documents
  - Contracts
  - Emails

The system should be able to answer questions like whether a particular medical procedure is covered under a specific insurance policy, based on the details provided in the query and the contents of the documents.

### Example Use Case

- **Input Query:** "46M, knee surgery, Pune, 3-month policy"
- **Expected Output:** "Yes, knee surgery is covered under the policy."

### Application Domains

This intelligent query-retrieval system is applicable in various sectors, including:

- **Insurance:** Determining policy coverage, claim eligibility, and exclusions.
- **Legal Compliance:** Extracting compliance requirements from legal documents.
- **Human Resources:** Retrieving specific clauses or employee entitlements from HR policies.
- **Contract Management:** Locating terms, obligations, or renewal conditions in contracts.

### Submission & Evaluation Process

1. **Team Formation:** Teams of 2-5 members from the same institution.
2. **Webinar:** Attend a session to understand the problem, evaluation criteria, and winning strategies.
3. **Solution Submission:** Submit a pitch deck and code demonstration, showcasing your approach and prototype.
4. **Prototype Presentation:** Selected teams present their working solutions to a panel of industry experts.

### Key Requirements

- **LLM Integration:** Use of Large Language Models for natural language understanding and information retrieval.
- **Scalability:** The system should handle large, unstructured document sets efficiently.
- **Accuracy:** Responses must be precise and contextually relevant.
- **Usability:** The interface should allow users to input queries naturally and receive clear, actionable answers.

### Rewards

Participants compete for attractive prizes and exclusive opportunities, with recognition for innovative and practical solutions[1].

This hackathon aims to push the boundaries of AI-driven document understanding, encouraging participants to solve real-world problems with cutting-edge technology.
